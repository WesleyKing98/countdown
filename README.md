# countdown
A countdown overlay app.


I made this livestream countdown overlay for a work project.
Currently, the configuration is set to be a 'lower third" on a livestream.
The green background is designed to be chroma-keyed out on OBS or similar editing software.

The 10 or so minutes prior to the livestream starting, we display slides on a loop, while this overlay is on the bottom letting people know when the stream will start.
